Microservices High-level architecture :
Eureka Server — service registry (single instance, run locally).

* student-service — student profiles, resume upload (store path / S3 later), view jobs, apply (calls placement-service & company-service as needed).

* company-service — company accounts, job postings, view applicants.

* placement-service — placement department dashboards, approve job postings, review/shortlist applications, update application status.

(optional later) API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) + Config Server + Notification Service.

Responsibility of company-service

company-service should do ONLY this:
* Manage company / recruiter profile
* Create, update, fetch company details
* No jobs yet (that belongs to job-service later)

Example responsibilities:

* Register company profile
* Update company profile
* Get company profile by ID
* List all companies (admin/placement use)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

company-service
Entities:
* Company { id, name, email, password, contactPerson, verified(Boolean), createdAt }
* Job { id, companyId, title, description, location, type, minYear, createdAt, isActive, approved(Boolean) }

APIs:

POST /companies — register
POST /companies/login
POST /companies/{companyId}/jobs — create job (initially isActive=false until placement approves)
GET /companies/{companyId}/jobs
GET /jobs/{jobId} — public job view
