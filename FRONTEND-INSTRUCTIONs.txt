📘 FRONTEND INSTRUCTION FILE
Job / Internship Portal – Microservices Demo Frontend

1. Project Context

This project is a backend-focused microservices demo implemented using Spring Boot.

Backend Architecture
* Services
	- student-service → port 9001
	- company-service → port 9002
	- placement-service → port 9003

* Infrastructure
	eureka-server → port 8761
	api-gateway (gateway-server) → port 9000

* Service Discovery: Eureka is used by backend services
* Database: H2 (file-based persistence)

* API Access Rule: 
	- Frontend must primarily communicate via API Gateway: http://localhost:9000
	- Direct service access is allowed ONLY as a fallback (for demo resilience when gateway is unavailable)
---
2. Purpose of Frontend

* This frontend is NOT production-grade
* It exists only to demonstrate backend functionality
* UI simplicity is preferred over visual polish
* No frontend frameworks are allowed
---

3. Technology Constraints (MANDATORY)

Use ONLY:
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript

Do NOT use:
* React / Angular / Vue
* jQuery
* Build tools or bundlers
* Node.js backend
---

4. Frontend Folder Structure (MANDATORY)

Create a new directory at the project root:

job-internship-portal/
  frontend/
    index.html
    config.js
    apiClient.js

    student-service/
      student.html
      student.css
      student.js

    company-service/
      company.html
      company.css
      company.js

    placement-service/
      placement.html
      placement.css
      placement.js

---

5. API Endpoints

Each service exposes REST APIs using standard CRUD patterns.

Service Base Paths:
| Service   | Base Path     |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Student   | `/students`   |
| Company   | `/companies`  |
| Placement | `/placements` |


Expected Endpoints
GET    /{service}
GET    /{service}/{id}
POST   /{service}
PUT    /{service}/{id}
DELETE /{service}/{id}

Final decisions must be taken after analysing the backend-code.
DTO structures should be inferred from backend responses.

---

6. API Gateway + Fallback Strategy (CRITICAL)

* Primary Call Path: Frontend → API Gateway (9000) → Service

* Fallback Call Path (DEMO ONLY): Frontend → Direct Service Port

Direct Service URLs:
| Service   | Fallback URL                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Student   | [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) |
| Company   | [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) |
| Placement | [http://localhost:9003](http://localhost:9003) |

---

7. Global Configuration File (config.js)

Create a centralized configuration file:

frontend/config.js:
const CONFIG = {
  GATEWAY_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:9000",

  SERVICES: {
    student: {
      path: "/students",
      fallbackUrl: "http://localhost:9001"
    },
    company: {
      path: "/companies",
      fallbackUrl: "http://localhost:9002"
    },
    placement: {
      path: "/placements",
      fallbackUrl: "http://localhost:9003"
    }
  }
};
No URLs may be hardcoded elsewhere.

---

8. Shared API Client with Fallback (apiClient.js)

All HTTP communication MUST go through a single helper.

Responsibilities :
	- Try API Gateway first

	- If gateway fails:

		- Retry using direct service URL

		- Log warning to console

	- Throw error only if BOTH attempts fail

Required Function: async function apiFetch(serviceName, endpoint = "", options = {})

Behavior:-
	a) Construct Gateway URL
	b) Call Gateway
	c) If failed:
		- Retry using fallback URL
	d) Return parsed JSON response

Service-specific JS files MUST NOT call fetch() directly.
---

9. Service-Specific JavaScript Rules

Each service JS file must:

	Import:	config.js, apiClient.js.
	Use ONLY:
		apiFetch("student")
		apiFetch("company")
		apiFetch("placement")

	Never hardcode: Ports, Base URLs, Paths.

---

10. UI Requirements (Per Service)
Each service page must include:
-> Functional Elements
	Form to create a new entity
	Button to fetch all records
	Optional:
		Fetch by ID
		Update by ID
		Delete by ID
-> Display:
	Render results in HTML tables
	Clear labels and headings
	Success / error messages for user actions

---

11. index.html (Landing Page)

Create a simple landing page:

Required Links (wrapped in buttons):
	- Student Service UI
	- Company Service UI
	- Placement Service UI

This page acts as the demo entry point.

---

12. Error Handling Rules

Gateway failure:
	Log warning
	Automatically trigger fallback

Service failure:
	Display user-friendly error message

Network failure:
	Display backend unavailable message

---

13. Demo Explanation Alignment (IMPORTANT)

The frontend must support the following explanation: “The UI always communicates via the API Gateway. A fallback mechanism exists only for demo resilience if the gateway fails. In production, direct service access would be disabled.”

---

14. Code Quality Expectations

Readable, commented code
Simple functions
No unnecessary abstractions
Focus on clarity over optimization

snake-case: html attibutes
camelCase: JS-variables
UPPERCASE: constants.

---

15. Summary

This frontend:
	- Is static.
	- Demonstrates microservices + gateway architecture.
	- Uses fallback only for demo robustness.
	- Exists to support backend evaluation.

Follow these instructions strictly.
